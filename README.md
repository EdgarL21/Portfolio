Added a get quote button using Jquery that when clicked will pull a random quote from a premade array and it will display it on the webpage. The quotes are from hearing them in school or from podcasts that've I've listened to.
Used the imgur API to get images from a premade album on imgur and used those images to randomly generate a new background every time the page is refreshed.
